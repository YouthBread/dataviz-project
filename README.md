This is the final project for Data visualization course WPI 2017Fall.

In this project, I'll dedicate to visualize the sports career of Kobe Bryant. I'll map all his shots and add some statistical analysis for different season.

The starter code here is from [Stylized Scatter Plot with Color Legend](https://bl.ocks.org/curran/ecb09f2605c7fbbadf0eeb75da5f0a6b).

## Development
For this project, I'm using `python -m http.server` for building local site.

> ## Development
>
> This project uses NPM and Webpack. To get started, clone the repository and install dependencies like this:
>
> ```
> cd dataviz-project-template
> npm install
> ```
>
> You'll need to build the JavaScript bundle using WebPack, using this command:
>
> ```
> npm run build
> ```
>
> To see the page run, you'll need to serve the site using a local HTTP server.
>
> ```
> npm install -g http-server
> http-server
> ```
>
> Now the site should be available at localhost:8080.
>
> For automatic refreshing during development, you can start the Webpack Dev Server like this:
>
> ```
> npm run serve
> ```
